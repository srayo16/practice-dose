            <p><b>The Ka'aba (الكعبة, lit. "the Cube") is the holiest mosque in Islam located in Mecca (Muhammad's city
                    of birth) and is figuratively known as the "House of God" (or Bayt Allah, lit. "House of Allah").
                    Another name for the Ka'aba is Masjid al-Haram, which means "Mosque of the sanctuary", where "the
                    sanctuary" is the name for the part of the city of Mecca that is considered sanctified.</b></p>
            <h1>Origins and ritual significance</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Prior to Muhammad claiming to receive revelations from Allah, the Ka'aba served as a popular pagan
                shrine that housed 360 idols and images of mostly pagan deities and attracted pilgrims and trade from
                many parts of Arabia. Particularly emphasized at this shrine during Muhammad's pre-Islamic years was the
                worship of the pagan Arab god Hubal, often symbolically affiliated with the crescent moon symbol.

                Islamic scriptures teach that Abraham (Ibrahim) built the Ka'aba with Ishmael around the time he
                "binded" Ishmael (a legend inspired by, though slightly different from, the Binding of Isaac).

            <h3>Qibla, or direction of prayer</h3>
            <p>Muslims worldwide face the Ka'aba in Mecca five times a day to preform their daily prayers (another of
                the
                Five Pillars of Islam). In this capacity, as the direction of prayer, the Ka'aba is referred to as the
                Qibla. While it is taught by orthodox Islam that the Qibla changed during Muhammad's lifetime from
                Jerusalem
                to the Ka'aba, some recent critical scholarship has suggested that early Muslims after Muhammad's death
                used
                to face the city of Petra for several decades. While critical research on the history of the Qibla has
                not
                yet proven entirely conclusive or achieved universal acceptance amongst scholars, these findings do cast
                a
                good deal of doubt on the orthodox belief in the finalization of the Qibla at the Ka'aba in Mecca during
                Muhammad's lifetime.</p>
            <h3>Hajj</h3>
            <p>
                Today, as with many Arabs during the pre-Islamic period, Muslims travel to the Ka'aba to perform the
                Hajj
                ceremony (which reflects in great detail the pilgrimage rituals of the pre-Islamic Arabs) at least once
                during their lifetime if they are financially and physically able.The Hajj is one of Islam's Five
                Pillars
                and has its rituals outlined in some detail in the Qur'an.
            </p>
            <h3>Black stone</h3>
            <p>Housed in the eastern corner of the Ka'aba's walls is the black stone, which is known to have been a
                sacred
                baetyl revered by the pre-Islamic Arabs. Islamic scriptures teach that the stone fell from heaven and
                was
                once completely white, only to be lost during Noah's flood and blackened by the sins of mankind. This
                stone
                is then said to have been provided back to Ibrahim by Gabriel as Ibrahim was constructing the Ka'aba</p>
            <b>According to historians</b>
            <p class="box">
                <b><span class="blue">[Patricia Crone.]</span></b>
                Allah is associated with a black stone, and some traditions hold that originally this stone
                was sacrificial [footnote: It owed its colour to the pagan practice of pouring blood and intestines over
                it (cf. U. Rubin, "Places of Worship in Mecca"). But as might be expected, there are also other
                explanations of its colour.]. This suggests that it was the stone rather than the building around it
                which was bayt allah, the house of god, and this gives us a perfect parallel with the Old Testament
                bethel. The cult of the Arab god Dusares (Dhu Shara) also seems to have centred on a black sacrificial
                stone. According to Epiphanius, he was worshipped together with his mother, the virginal Kaabou, or in
                other words ka'ib or ka' 'ab, a girl with swelling breasts. A similar arrangement is met in a Nabataean
                inscription from Petra that speaks of sacrificial stones (nsyb' = ansab) belonging to "the lord of this
                house" (mr' byt) and al-Uzza, another ka'ib lady. If we assume that bayt and ka'ba alike originally
                referred to the Meccan stone rather than the building around it, then the lord of the Meccan house was a
                pagan Allah worshipped in conjunction with a female consort such as al-Uzza and/or other "daughters of
                God." This would give us a genuinely pagan deity for Quraysh and at the same time explain their devotion
                to goddesses.
            </p>
            The above view is outlined by Crone as a possibility among others. <br> <br>

            <h1>Structural history</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Islamic scriptures state that the original Ka'aba built by Abraham was rather more rectangular than
                cubic, but that due to reconstruction the Ka'aba had lost its original dimensions. The story recorded
                suggests that the Ka'aba, when Muhammad was growing up, used to be rectangular in shape but that a
                natural disaster decimated the structure such that it had to be rebuilt. The Quraysh, revering this
                structure, are said to have lacked sufficient "clean money" (that is, money untainted by sinful
                business, such as gambling and prostitution), and thus were only able to rebuild the temple in the shape
                of a cube. It is thus suggested that the short, semi-circular wall opposite the Iraqi (northwestern)
                wall of the Ka'aba delineates the portion of earth which in fact, counts as a part of the Ka'aba itself,
                despite its falling beyond the Ka'aba's walls. Consequently, pilgrims circumambulating the Ka'aba are
                able to earn the blessing of having "entered it" without having to step inside.

                The Ka'aba has been destroyed deliberately and by natural disasters and thus reconstructed several times
                over since the seventh century.</p>

            <p>The following verses describe the origins of the Ka'aba</p>
            <p>Note that "Becca" here is said to refer to Mecca, although some critical scholars have suggested that the
                word is simply a typographical error or misspelling.</p>

            <p>96. Lo! the first Sanctuary appointed for mankind was that at Becca, a blessed place, a guidance to the
                peoples;</p>
            <p>97. Wherein are plain memorials (of Allah's guidance); the place where Abraham stood up to pray; and
                whosoever entereth it is safe. And pilgrimage to the House is a duty unto Allah for mankind, for him who
                can find a way thither. As for him who disbelieveth, (let him know that) lo! Allah is Independent of

                Ishmael, (saying): Purify My house for those who go around and those who meditate therein and those who
                bow down and prostrate themselves (in worship).</p>
            <p>126. And when Abraham prayed: My Lord! Make this a region of security and bestow upon its people fruits,
                such of them as believe in Allah and the Last Day, He answered: As for him who disbelieveth, I shall
                leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the doom of Fire - a hapless journey's
                end!</p>
            <p>
                127. And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, (Abraham prayed): Our Lord!
                Accept from us (this duty). Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower.
            </p>
            <p>128. Our Lord! And make us submissive unto Thee and of our seed a nation submissive unto Thee, and show
                us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Relenting, the Merciful.</p>
            <p>129. Our Lord! And raise up in their midst a messenger from among them who shall recite unto them Thy
                revelations, and shall instruct them in the Scripture and in wisdom and shall make them grow. Lo! Thou,
